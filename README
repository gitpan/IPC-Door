INTRODUCTION

IPC::Door is a Perl extension that interfaces with the door
library, found in Solaris 2.6 and later.

WHAT IS A DOOR?

The doors are a fast IPC mechanism on a local machine.

	"A new, fast, lightweight mechanism for calling procedures between
	processes is available in Solaris: doors.  Doors are a low-latency
	method of invoking a procedure in local processes.  A door server
	contains a thread that sleeps, waiting for an invocation from the
	door client.  A client makes a call to the server through the door,
	along with a small (16 Kbyte) payload.  When the call is made from
	a door client to a door server, scheduling control is passed
	directly to the thread in the door server.  Once a door server
	finished handling the request, it passes control and response back
	to the calling thread.  The scheduling control allows ultra-low-
	latency turnaround because the client does not need to wait for the
	server thread to be scheduled to complete the request."
			--Jim Mauro and Richard McDougal, "Solaris Internals," 2001

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

I recommend that you read Makefile.PL to make sure you know what it
does, and check the content of the "t" directory for what it tests, some
examples, and a simple-minded benchmark script.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the door library.  This version assumes the API
found in Solaris 2.6 and later.

There is a project that attempts to implement the API in Linux.  See
<http://ldoor.sourceforge.net> for more information.
