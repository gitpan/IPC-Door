INTRODUCTION

IPC::Door is a Perl extension that interfaces with the door
library, found in Solaris 2.6 and later.

WHAT IS A DOOR?

The doors are a fast IPC mechanism on a local machine.

	"A new, fast, lightweight mechanism for calling procedures between
	processes is available in Solaris: doors.  Doors are a low-latency
	method of invoking a procedure in local processes.  A door server
	contains a thread that sleeps, waiting for an invocation from the
	door client.  A client makes a call to the server through the door,
	along with a small (16 Kbyte) payload.  When the call is made from
	a door client to a door server, scheduling control is passed
	directly to the thread in the door server.  Once a door server
	finished handling the request, it passes control and response back
	to the calling thread.  The scheduling control allows ultra-low-
	latency turnaround because the client does not need to wait for the
	server thread to be scheduled to complete the request."
			--Jim Mauro and Richard McDougal, "Solaris Internals," 2001

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

I recommend that you read Makefile.PL to make sure you know what it
does, and check the content of the "t" directory for what it tests, some
examples, and a simple-minded benchmark script.

If you are building with non-default "perl", then you may have to edit
the shebang lines of t/*.pl to run tests successfully.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the door library.  This version assumes the API
found in Solaris 2.6 and later.

Sun revised portions of the Door API with Solaris 10.  While I am making
my best effort to keep current with the changes, I also appreciate your
bug reports if this module deviates from it.

There is a project that attempts to implement the API in Linux.  See
<http://ldoor.sourceforge.net> for more information.
