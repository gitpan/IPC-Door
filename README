IPC/Door version 0.03
=============================

INTRODUCTION

IPC::Door is a Perl extension that interfaces with the door
library, found in Solaris 2.6 and later.

WHAT IS A DOOR?

The doors are a fast IPC mechanism on a local machine.

	"A new, fast, lightweight mechanism for calling procedures between
	processes is available in Solaris: doors.  Doors are a low-latency
	method of invoking a procedure in local processes.  A door server
	contains a thread that sleeps, waiting for an invocation from the
	door client.  A client makes a call to the server through the door,
	along with a small (16 Kbyte) payload.  When the call is made from
	a door client to a door server, scheduling control is passed
	directly to the thread in the door server.  Once a door server
	finished handling the request, it passes control and response back
	to the calling thread.  The scheduling control allows ultra-low-
	latency turnaround because the client does not need to wait for the
	server thread to be scheduled to complete the request."
			--Jim Mauro and Richard McDougal, "Solaris Internals," 2001

In an informal benchmarking, the current implementation of IPC::Door
has been shown to be about 3 times faster than the two-way named pipes.
